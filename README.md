BFCP message/client/server libraries
====================================

This repository contains a set of libraries implementing different aspects of the BFCP ([Binary Floor Control Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4582)), specifically:

* `bfcpmsg`: a library to implement parsing/building capabilities for the protocol;
* `bfcpclt`: a library to implement the client side of the protocol;
* `bfcpsrv`: a library to implement the server side of the protocol.

The libraries were originally implemented by Lorenzo Miniero (University of Napoli Federico II) and Oscar Novo (Ericsson), and are not hosted in a [Meetecho](http://www.meetecho.com) repository to make them more easily accessible.

The license for all libraries is LGPL 3.0 ([GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](COPYING)).
